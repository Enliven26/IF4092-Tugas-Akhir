                "commit_message": "Okay, I need to write a concise commit message based on the Git diff and relevant source code provided. The user has given four different Git diffs and their corresponding relevant source code, each with a commit type. I need to handle each one individually.\n\nStarting with Git diff 1, which is about the hadoop-common-project. The diff shows changes in the CopyCommands.java and TestFsShellCopy.java files. Looking at the changes, the main addition is a new option called \"-skip-empty-file\" in the getmerge command. This option allows users to skip adding newline delimiters for empty files when using the -nl flag. The commit type is 'feat', so it's a feature addition. The commit message should reflect this, mentioning the new option and its purpose, along with the relevant JIRA issue HADOOP-12657. Also, the test cases were updated to include this new option, so that should be mentioned in the body.\n\nMoving on to Git diff 2, which is in the activemq-client project. The changes are in the BaseDataStreamMarshaller.java file. The main change here is the addition of a method called cutMessageIfNeeded, which truncates exception messages to a maximum size of 1024 characters, appending '...' if they exceed this limit. This is a fix to prevent resource exhaustion, so the commit type is 'fix'. The commit message should explain that exception messages are now truncated and mention the JIRA issue AMQ-6894.\n\nGit diff 3 is from the Cassandra project, specifically the HintsDispatchTrigger.java file. The change removes a schema version check during hint dispatch. This allows hints to be dispatched even during schema mismatches, improving cluster resilience. The commit type is 'fix', so the message should state that the schema version check is removed and reference the JIRA issue CASSANDRA-20188.\n\nLastly, Git diff 4 is another change in the hadoop-common-project, this time in RunJar.java. The modification involves creating a temporary directory with specific permissions using PosixFilePermissions. Previously, the code used File.createTempFile, which might not set the correct permissions. The new approach uses Files.createTempDirectory with the correct attributes. The commit type is 'chore', indicating a maintenance or refactoring task. The commit message should explain the change in how the temporary directory is created and mention the permissions set.\n\nI need to ensure each commit message follows the specified format: type: subject, followed by a concise body that wraps at one to three sentences. Also, include any relevant test changes or side effects. Avoid any additional comments or annotations.\n\nFor each commit message, I'll structure it as:\n\n{type}: {subject}\n\n{body}\n\nNow, I'll draft each commit message based on the analysis.\n### Commit Message 1\n\n**Type:** feat  \n**Subject:** add -skip-empty-file option to getmerge  \n\n**Body:**  \nAdd flag to skip appending newline delimiters for empty files when using -nl [HADOOP-12657]. Includes tests validating flag behavior for zero-byte files.\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 2\n\n**Type:** fix  \n**Subject:** truncate exception messages to prevent resource exhaustion  \n\n**Body:**  \nLimit exception message size to 1024 characters with ... suffix [AMQ-6894]. This reduces memory/thread consumption from oversized messages during repeated failover attempts.\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 3\n\n**Type:** fix  \n**Subject:** remove schema version check for hint delivery  \n\n**Body:**  \nAllow dispatching hints during schema mismatches to improve upgrade/mixed-version cluster resilience [CASSANDRA-20188].\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 4\n\n**Type:** chore  \n**Subject:** improve temporary directory creation in RunJar  \n\n**Body:**  \nCreate temporary directory with correct permissions using PosixFilePermissions.

Let me go through each one step by step.\n\nStarting with Git diff 1, it's about modifying the CopyCommands.java file. The changes include adding a new option \"-skip-empty-file\" to the getmerge command. The usage string and description are updated to reflect this new option. Also, the processOptions method now parses this new option, and the processArguments method now checks if the file is empty before adding a newline. There's a new helper method writeDelimiter. The test file TestFsShellCopy.java is updated to include tests for this new option. The context provided is HADOOP-12657, which is a feature request to skip newlines on empty files. So the commit type is 'feat', and the message should mention adding this option and include the ticket ID.\n\nNext, Git diff 2 modifies BaseDataStreamMarshaller.java. It adds a constant MAX_EXCEPTION_MESSAGE_SIZE and a method cutMessageIfNeeded to truncate messages. The marshal methods now use this method to limit message size. The context is AMQ-6894, a bug where excessive connections cause resource exhaustion. The commit type is 'fix', and the message should explain truncating messages to prevent this issue.\n\nGit diff 3 changes HintsDispatchTrigger.java by removing a schema version check during hint dispatch. The context is CASSANDRA-20188, a bug where hints couldn't be delivered during schema mismatches. The commit type is 'fix', and the message should state that the schema check is removed to allow delivery.\n\nGit diff 4 updates CLIManager.java and MavenCli.java to handle deprecated options better. Deprecated options now have more detailed attributes, and there's a set to track used deprecated options. The logging method now checks for deprecated options and logs warnings or errors. The context is MNG-8237, a bug about redundant deprecation notices. The commit type is 'refactor', and the message should mention improving deprecation handling.\n\nNow, I'll structure each commit message according to the guidelines, ensuring the subject is clear, the body includes relevant context and ticket IDs, and it's concise.\n### Commit Message 1\n\n**Type:** feat  \n**Subject:** add -skip-empty-file option to getmerge  \n\n**Body:**  \nAdd flag to skip appending newline delimiters for empty files when using -nl [HADOOP-12657]. Includes tests validating flag behavior for zero-byte files.\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 2\n\n**Type:** fix  \n**Subject:** truncate exception messages to prevent resource exhaustion  \n\n**Body:**  \nLimit exception message size to 1024 characters with ... suffix [AMQ-6894]. This reduces memory/thread consumption from oversized messages during repeated failover attempts.\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 3\n\n**Type:** fix  \n**Subject:** remove schema version check for hint delivery  \n\n**Body:**  \nAllow dispatching hints during schema mismatches to improve upgrade/mixed-version cluster resilience [CASSANDRA-20188].\n\n---\n\n### Commit Message 4\n\n**Type:** refactor  \n**Subject:** improve handling of deprecated command-line options  \n\n**Body:**  \nEnhance deprecated option management by adding detailed deprecation attributes and tracking usage [MNG-8237]. Prevents redundant warnings and improves documentation accuracy."
