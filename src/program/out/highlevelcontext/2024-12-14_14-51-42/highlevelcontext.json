"**1. Twibbon**\nThe Twibbon feature allows users to overlay an image onto their photos. While this may seem unrelated to financial transaction management, it is a request from the stakeholders. The Twibbon feature will be implemented on a separate page of the application, where users can open the camera to capture a photo with the Twibbon overlay. At least one Twibbon image should be provided, and if multiple images are available, users should be given the option to switch between them. Once the user captures a photo, it will be displayed but not saved on the device. Users can capture additional photos as needed. The specific images used for the Twibbon can be selected as per the development team's discretion.\n\n**11. Network Sensing - Signal Detection**\n**Internet Connectivity Check**: The application must be able to check if the device is currently connected to the internet, either via mobile data or Wi-Fi.\n**No Internet Connection Alert**: If the device is disconnected from the internet, a simple pop-up should appear indicating that the device is not connected to the internet.\n**Offline Access**: The application should remain accessible even without an internet connection; however, it should not be able to make requests or pull data from the server while offline.\n**Server Data Request Handling**: If a page requires data from the server and the internet connection is unavailable, a simple page should be displayed indicating that there is no internet connection, rather than showing a blank page.\n\n- **Real-time Logging**: Field teams can record transactions instantly, including attaching digital receipts and categorizing expenses.\n- **Approval Workflow**: Supervisors can review and approve transactions directly within the application to ensure compliance with financial protocols.\n- **Budget Monitoring**: Automatically tracks expenditures against allocated budgets for each mission, providing alerts for potential overruns.\n- **Offline Functionality**: Ensures uninterrupted operation in areas with limited connectivity, with data synchronization when back online.\n- **Comprehensive Reporting**: Generates detailed financial reports for audits and transparency with stakeholders.\nThe application must be designed for Android devices to align with the organization\u00e2\u20ac\u2122s standard equipment for field operations. It is expected to enhance accountability, reduce errors, and streamline financial processes during missions."
